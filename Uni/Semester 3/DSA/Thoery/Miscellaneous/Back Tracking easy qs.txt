🟢 Level 1: Small Choices

Binary Strings of Length n
Generate all binary strings of length n.
Example for n=2: ["00","01","10","11"].

👉 Teaches: each position has 2 choices (0 or 1).

🟢 Level 2: Subsets & Combinations

All Subsets (Power Set)
Given nums = [1,2,3], return all subsets.
Example: [[], [1], [2], [3], [1,2], [1,3], [2,3], [1,2,3]].

👉 Teaches: at each step, take or skip the element.

Combinations
Choose k numbers from 1..n.
Example: n=4, k=2 → [[1,2],[1,3],[1,4],[2,3],[2,4],[3,4]].

👉 Teaches: controlling recursion depth.

🟢 Level 3: Ordering

Permutations
Given nums=[1,2,3], return all permutations.
Example: [[1,2,3],[1,3,2],[2,1,3],[2,3,1],[3,1,2],[3,2,1]].

👉 Teaches: marking elements as used, exploring all orderings.

🟢 Level 4: Constraints

Generate Valid Parentheses
Given n, generate all strings with n pairs of valid parentheses.
Example n=3: ["((()))","(()())","(())()","()(())","()()()"].

👉 Teaches: adding constraints (open <= n, close <= open).
